# Python-to-SIS, the next generation #

Python-to-SIS, the next generation (py2sisng) is the easiest cross-platform way to create Symbian OSâ„¢ installation packages (SIS) from [Python for S60](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60) scripts.

SIS files made with py2sisng work on S60 1st and 2nd Edition phones. For 3rd Edition phones there's [Ensymble](http://ensymble.googlecode.com/).

Main page of py2sisng is in the [Wiki](Welcome.md).
